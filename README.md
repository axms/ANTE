## ANTE: A framework for autonomous botnet detection

The high costs generated by attacks and the increasing number of different devices on the Internet of Things (IoT) bolster
the necessity for the early detection of botnets (i.e., the network of infected devices) as a way to gain advantage against
attacks. However, early botnet detection is a challenging task given the continuous malware mutation, sophistication, and
massive data volume. In a nutshell, the literature addresses botnets by modeling the behavior of malware spread, the
classification of malicious traffic, and the analysis of traffic anomalies. 


The ANTE system adapts itself to different scenarios and learns
how to detect different types of botnets throughout its execution. Hence, the ANTE system autonomously selects the most
appropriate ML pipeline for each type of botnet and improves the correct classification before an attack effectively begins.
